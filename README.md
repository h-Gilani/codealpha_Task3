Credit Scoring Model
Overview
This repository contains a project focused on developing a Credit Scoring Model to predict the creditworthiness of applicants. The model uses features such as income, age, loan amount, and credit history to determine the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on their credit obligations.

Project Description
The goal of this project was to build a predictive model capable of assessing credit risk, using historical data to make informed predictions about new applicants. This model is implemented using Python and leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate credit scoring.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Utilized median imputation for numeric features to address any missing data.
Categorical Encoding: Converted categorical data (credit_history) into numeric format using manual mapping to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to scale numeric features, ensuring consistent data distribution for the model.
Model Training:

Algorithm: Used RandomForestClassifier for classification, leveraging ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix to validate its effectiveness.
Prediction:

New Data: Implemented functionality to predict creditworthiness for new applicants based on the trained model.
Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository and follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-scoring-model.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd credit-scoring-model
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure that the credit_data.csv file is in the same directory as the script or update the file path accordingly.

Run the Model:

bash
Copy code
python credit_scoring_model.py
This will execute the preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the model.

Prediction: Modify the new_data section in the script to include new applicantsâ€™ data and run the prediction section to obtain creditworthiness assessments.

Project Details
Data Source: The dataset used contains features such as income, age, loan amount, and credit history.
Performance Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with results visualized using confusion matrix.
